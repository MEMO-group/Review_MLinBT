# Tutorial
This repository contains the accompanying tutorial to "Improving the performance of machine learning models for biotechnology: The quest for deus ex machina". You find all info in the jupyter notebook "Tutorial" in this repository.
 <br /> <br />
<h2>Technical Prerequisites</h2>

This tutorial is built in <a href="https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Jupyter notebook</a> with code written in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/">Python 3</a>. It is made available publically through GitHub.

If you wish to run or modify code cells yourself:
1. Install Python and Jupyter notebook or use <a href="https://mybinder.org/">Binder</a> online (changes are not saved in this case). To run files locally, download this tutorial and open it via Jupyter Notebook (for example via Anaconda).
2. To run a code cell (blocks preceded by ```[ ]:```), select it and press ```Ctrl + Enter```. In Jupyter notebooks, cells have to be run sequentially to store variables correctly. 
3. Comments in code cells are preceded by # and are not interpreted as code.  
 <br /> <br />
You might need to install the following packages:
* numpy 1.19.2
* pandas 1.1.3
* matplotlib 3.3.2
* scipy 1.5.2
* sklearn 0.23.2
